# GoBlog
> GoBlog - it's blog on Golang

ENG | [RU](README.md)

## Target

I am developing this project to gain experience and skills in unit tests.
I want to learn how to expose an application with really good tests that will correlate with all quality criteria.


## Why blog?

Because it is the simplest web application. Most often, such applications do not have any simple things.
At work, and in a different stack, I wrote complex industrial applications, so the blog is a simple task in comparison.
